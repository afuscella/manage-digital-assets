## Understanding the project structure 

File or Folder | Purpose
---------------|----------
`app/`         | content for UI frontends
`db/`          | cds domain models and data
`srv/`         | cds service models and code

_refer to the base path:_ `packages/assets`


#### Install dependencies 

Install the database and services dependecies.

```
cd packages/assets
npm install
```

and finally the app

```
cd packages/assets/app/assets
npm install
```

now we're done to get really started.


## Project Overview

Project consist in having application deployed in Cloud Foundry, and exposes the service layer through a route. The odata can be accessed, and a fiori representation can be called in order to display it on web.

## Run the project in CF

#### Connect to your CF account

- Login to Cloud Foundry environment by executing the statement below. Make sure you have configured the right CF api endpoint at the file. Enter your password when prompted.

``` windows
# windows
cf_login.bat

# unix
cf_login.sh
```
Once you are logged, you should see the your API endpoint, user, organisation, and space.

- Add the SAP HANA driver and client into your project

```bash
npm add hana
```

Adjust the `package.json` at `packages/assets/` folder by changing the `db.kind` to `hana`

```json
...
  "db": {
    "kind": "hana"
  }
...
```


#### Create a HANA Service in CF

```
cf create-service hanatrial hdi-shared ${APPLICATION_NAME}-hdi-container
```


#### Build and Deploy

Now that the service is create, you're now able to bind apps to the newly service.

```
cds build
cf push -f gen/db

#--random-route (optional)
cf push -f gen/srv 
```

Once it get finished, use `cf apps` to check whether application is running and which route is assigned with.


#### Run Run Run

Access your CF account, more precisely the `dev` space, and access the `assets-srv` app to get the application route.
